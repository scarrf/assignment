        Using Stem cells to develop human Hearts.
    </h>

    <h>Introduction</h>
    <br>
<div id="intro">
    <br>
     By inducing stem cells into a miniature human heart, an Organoid was developed for the facilitation of research. Different signaling molecules are used to specifically mimic the pathway of heart development by using pluripotent steams and centrifugation. The Organoid contains heart muscle cells and the outer layer of the heart wall. While previous researchers were able to culture endocardium cells, this news tells us about the recent breakthrough in discovering the pathway of the culturing epicardium. As a result, the Organoid can contract like a human heart with the implementation of electrical stimulation.

    The Mysteries of the human heart
</h>
<br>
<div id="mys">
    Previously, it is unknown how the fetal heart can self-repair, which is absent in adult hearts. Some precursor stem cells were found during the development of the Organoid heart, but it only exists for a few days during culture. These clues may lead scientists to develop better treatment methods for heart attacks.

<h>Treatment of Diseases.</h>
<br>
<div id="context">
    <p1>IPSCs involve the ectopic expression of somatic cells and reprogramming them into cells like Embryonic stem cells. It is pluripotent with self-renewal properties. Ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of embryonic stem cells can be resolved by using IPSCs as it is derived from adult somatic cells, removing the possibility of abortion.</p1> 
    <p2>The emulation of min-human hearts can be tested by drugs directly, which is essential for drug screening. Fewer animal experiments are required for testing and increasing the reliability of those tests by minimizing the genetic differences between humans and mice. </p2>
    <p3>While it is not possible for heart replacement through surgeries, Organoids can be used to study numerous genetic illnesses. By extracting pluripotent stem cells suffering from Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome patients, researchers can emulate the development and conditions of heart conditions. Hence, disease models can be created in order to allow scientists to comprehend the mechanisms of such genetic defects.</p3>
    <p4>As previously mentioned, such discoveries gave us clues about heart development and unknown stem cells. As Organoids are cultured by patient-specific somatic cells, it does not require histocompatibility for testing. Moreover, immune rejection can be avoided, which may pave the way for regenerative medicine and heart replacement through growing hearts artificially.</p4>
</div>
<br>
<h>Limitations of such development</h>
<br>
<div id="limitations">
<p5>Pluripotent cells can give rise to any type of cells except those needed for fetal development. There are possibilities for such cells to develop vastly different cell types due to purity and yield issues. Cancer may be formed easily due to its ability to proliferate indefinitely in culture.</p5>
<p6>While these limitations do not negatively affect the research on human heart development, they may pose problems if such technology is used for clinical uses. </p6>
